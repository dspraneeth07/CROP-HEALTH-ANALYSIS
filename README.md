# Crop Health Analysis - Xpedition R Research Group

## Developed & Designed by: Dhadi Sai Praneeth Reddy

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Xpedition R Research Group** initiative to assist farmers in diagnosing crop diseases using machine learning. The web application leverages the power of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model, optimized for crop disease detection, to analyze images uploaded by users and provide actionable insights.

### Key Features:
- **Crop Disease Diagnosis:** The system analyzes uploaded crop images and provides disease predictions.
- **Actionable Reports:** The results include the disease name, causes, prevention steps, and treatment recommendations.
- **Multi-language Support:** The system provides results and reports in multiple languages including English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Tamil.
- **Farmer-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive user interface for uploading images and getting instant analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of their crops via the web interface.
2. **Disease Diagnosis:** The system uses the ViT model to detect any diseases in the uploaded image.
3. **Results & Recommendations:** The system provides a detailed analysis of the crop's health, including:
   - Disease name
   - Confidence level
   - Disease description
   - Causes and prevention steps
   - Treatment recommendations (medicines, dosage, and application instructions)
4. **Downloadable Report:** The results are formatted into a detailed PDF report which can be downloaded by the user.

## Deployment
The project is deployed and can be accessed live at [https://xpdtnrcha.netlify.app/](https://xpdtnrcha.netlify.app/).
